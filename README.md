Android java platform development eclipse project

- Handpicked .classfile for eclipse project.
- For anyone who want to inspect android java platform.

- Eclipse is strict on filename, classname and package path but android is not strict on that.
- Some classes has wrong filename or path. That sholud be fixed manually.
